		<h1>AUSTRALIA</h1>
<img src="Mapa.jpg" alt="Map of Australia">
<p>Australia is a land of dreams. From the sacred legends of the aboriginal Dreamtime, when the great spirits conjured the coral reefs, rainforests, and scorched red deserts, to armchair travelers who describe Australia as their dream destination, the Land Down Under deserves all the hype. The world's smallest continent and largest island, Australia is almost the same size as the United States but with a population the size of New York State and some of the quirkiest wildlife on the planet.</p>
<p>Australia is also a land of staggering contrasts and spectacular beauty. Along the coast, you can explore vibrant multicultural cities, vast sand islands, ancient rainforests, and one of the planet's most awe-inspiring natural wonders - the Great Barrier Reef. In the Outback, rugged national parks and red-earthed deserts offer the ultimate in adventure travel. </p>

    	<p>The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park protects a large part of Australia's Great Barrier Reef from damaging activities. It is a vast multiple-use Marine Park which supports a wide range of uses, including commercial marine tourism, fishing, ports and shipping, recreation, scientific research and Indigenous traditional use. Fishing and the removal of artefacts or wildlife (fish, coral, seashells, etc.) is strictly regulated, and commercial shipping traffic must stick to certain specific defined shipping routes that avoid the most sensitive areas of the park. </p>
    	<img src="Great Barrier Reef.jpg" alt="Great Barrier Reef">
    	<p>The Great Barrier Reef is the largest and best known coral reef ecosystem in the world. Its reefs, almost 3000 in total, represent about 10 per cent of all the coral reef areas in the world. It supports an amazing variety of biodiversity, providing a home to thousands of coral and other invertebrate species, bony fish, sharks, rays, marine mammals, marine turtles, sea snakes, as well as algae and other marine plants</p>

		<img src="Sydney Opera House - Day.jpg" alt="Sydney Opera House - Day">
		<p>“It stands by itself as one of the indisputable masterpieces of human creativity, not only in the 20th century but in the history of humankind.” Expert evaluation report to the UNESCO World Heritage Committee, 2007.<br>Fusing ancient and modernist influences, and built on a site sacred to the local Gadigal people for thousands of years, the sculptural elegance of the Sydney Opera House has made it one of the most recognisable buildings of the twentieth century, synonymous with inspiration and imagination.As Pritzker Prize judge Frank Gehry said when awarding architecture’s highest award to the Opera House’s architect in 2003: “[Jørn] Utzon made a building well ahead of its time, far ahead of available technology... a building that changed the image of an entire country.”Built to “help mould a better and more enlightened community,” in the words of New South Wales Premier Joseph Cahill in 1954, the Sydney Opera House has been home to many of the world’s greatest artists and performances, and a meeting place for matters of local and international significance since opening in 1973.</p>
		<img src="Sydney Opera House - Night.jpg" alt="Sydney Opera House - Night">
		<p>But while the tale of the Opera House is one of breathtaking triumph, it is also one of personal cost. The building’s design was inspired - entirely unlike anything that had been seen before. Pressures piled upon its architect, Jørn Utzon, who left Australia midway through construction, never to return to see the building completed.Nevertheless, Utzon’s masterpiece would define his career, and redefine the image of Australia both to itself and the world. An exercise in nation building, as Joe Cahill underlined, it was an extraordinary collective act of dreaming in public; a work of art built for the performance of works of art and brought to life by people who believed in the power of imagination.Realising the dream took us all - visionaries and pragmatists, politicians and architects, engineers, artists and, most fundamentally, the people of Australia.</p>

		<p>Kangaroo Island is famous as a feral-free haven where native animals flourish. But if visitors are surprised at how easy it is to see marsupials, they're more astonished by the scale and diversity of the place. Kangaroo Island is 155 kilometres from east to west, a place of lagoons, white-sand beaches and sea cliffs pounded by thunderous swells. It's populated by just 5000 people and is home to a remarkably strong food culture as well as one of the world's most highly regarded luxury lodges. Perhaps most importantly, it also offers that quintessential island experience – a sense that time has slowed and the rest of the world is somewhere else. </p>
		<img src="Kangaroo.jpg" alt="Kangaroo">
		<p>Wildlife enthusiasts can lose themselves for weeks on the island, but most visitors confine themselves to five must-see animals. Australian sea lions take refuge in the stunning sands of Seal Bay, the place where you can do guided ranger walks among this threatened species. Koalas hang out at the entrance to Flinders Chase National Park, the vast forested refuge that covers a full third of the island. Endemic island kangaroos can be seen at dusk and dawn across the island's rolling farmland (a landscape as lovely as any). Within the island's labyrinth of quiet dirt roads, echidnas can be spotted on the verges. And don't miss the nightly 5pm feeding time of pelicans at the small capital, Kingscote, one of the most joyous affairs on the island.</p>
